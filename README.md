# Interactive Pattern Designer

A simple JavaScript browser application for creating and saving colored grid patterns. This tool allows 
users to create a grid of any size, fill it with colors, view the pattern in a run-length 
encoded format, and save the resulting image with a click of a button.

Note, only four colors are considered, as this is meant as prototyping tool for a 
4-color-changer on a PASSAP knitting machine.

## Features

- Interactively color the grid using a palette of 4 colors. 
- Display the pattern in a run-length encoded format.
- Save the designed pattern as an image file.
